# Hi, guys! Welcome back to my advanced programming journal.
## Today, I am going to show you an exploratory data analysis (or EDA in other term) on a dataset containing information about popular tracks on most streamed spotify songs 2023 entitled "Spotify's Most Played All-Time: For You" Sounds fun, right?
The idea behind the "For You" title is to create a space where people can reconnect with the music and artists that helped them through 2023â€”a kind of "For You Playlist" designed for nostalgia. This project is meant to be a way for people to revisit and remember the songs that carried them through challenging times, capturing the music that might otherwise be forgotten but still holds a special place in their hearts, as someone who has been through so much the past year
### Jessie Mae Domingo of 2ECE-D, at your service! Feel free to use my project as your reference for your new playlist.


#### Here are the General Objectives that I want to meet as we dive into our Spotify Playlist Project.
##### a. Examine the dataset's structure.
To understand its layout, noting any missing values and checking data types. 
This will give an initial sense of the variables available.

##### b. Provide Summary Statistics.
Like the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes 
(e.g., BPM, danceability) to provide an overview of the data.

##### c. Uses Visualizations.
Such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to identify 
trends and patterns. Ensure that each chart is clearly labeled for easy interpretation.

##### d. Analyze Correlations.
To reveal relationships between different features. Look into connections between 
streams and musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlist presence.

##### e. Draw Insights and Make Recommendations.
Based on your analysis regarding tracks, artists, or music trends. 
Highlight elements that may help understand what makes a track popular.
